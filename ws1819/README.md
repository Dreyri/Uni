# WS1819

This semester I will try to document most of the notes I'll write, to practice both my
skills with git as well as using emacs for taking notes.

I'm not quite sure which language to use, I'd prefer English but translating all German
to English might be cumbersome so I think I'll try it out and decide next semester.
